# Disseration-Stress_Analysis
Social media is one of the most common way for people to express "stress" nowadays. 
Therefore, I conducted a sentiment analysis to extract information and identify stress from social media posts. 
This project leverages the power of natural language processing (NLP), BERT and supervised learning to build models that accurately classify stressful and non-stressful posts.
It was inspired by the newly published paper called Dreaddit: A Reddit Dataset for Stress Analysis in Social Media.
